My name is Hang Zhou, and I am currently a third-year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Prof. Xiaopeng "Shaw" Li](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/staff/xiaopengli/). I have a Master's degree from UW-Madison and a Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I worked with [Prof. Hu Qin](https://cm.hust.edu.cn/info/1745/24587.htm) and [Prof. Chun Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/chun123cheng/home). My research focuses on automated vehicle control and evaluation. You can find my academic works on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=JEih5loAAAAJ&hl) and learn more about me on my [Lab page](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/staff/zhou-hang/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hang-zhou-50722a2a5/).

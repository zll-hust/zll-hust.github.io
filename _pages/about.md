## About me

My name is Hang Zhou, and I am a final year Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the [Connected & Autonomous Transportation Systems (CATS) Laboratory](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiaopeng “Shaw” Li](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/staff/xiaopengli/). I got a Master’s degree from UW–Madison at 2025 and a Bachelor’s degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology at 2023, where I worked with [Prof. Hu Qin](https://cm.hust.edu.cn/info/1745/24587.htm) and [Prof. Chun Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/chun123cheng/home).

## Research interests

My research mainly applies methods from artificial intelligence and optimization to address the challenges posed by **emerging technologies in transportation**. My current research focuses on **Production Automated Vehicle (PAV) evaluation**. Since PAV manufacturers always do not disclose the internal control algorithms, we propose a data-driven pipeline for evaluating PAV performance from PAV-related data. To promote research across different steps of this pipeline, we initiated an open-source ecosystem: **the [OpenPAV](https://github.com/OpenPAV/OpenPAV) platform**. Our goal is to establish a billboard showcasing the performance ranking of various PAV brands to offer the public a scientific reference.

Besides, I'm also interested in the **routing, trajectory planning, and montion control of robotics** and **urban air mobility**. I'm always trying to integrate theoretical analysis with physical tests.

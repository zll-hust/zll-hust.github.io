My name is Hang Zhou, and I am currently a third-year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the [Connected & Autonomous Transportation Systems (CATS) Laboratory](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiaopeng "Shaw" Li](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/staff/xiaopengli/). I have a Master's degree from UW-Madison and a Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I worked with [Prof. Hu Qin](https://cm.hust.edu.cn/info/1745/24587.htm) and [Prof. Chun Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/chun123cheng/home). My research focuses on automated vehicle control and evaluation.

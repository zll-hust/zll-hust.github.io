## About me

My name is Hang Zhou, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the [Connected & Autonomous Transportation Systems (CATS) Laboratory](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiaopeng “Shaw” Li](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/staff/xiaopengli/). I hold a Master’s degree from UW–Madison and a Bachelor’s degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where I worked with [Prof. Hu Qin](https://cm.hust.edu.cn/info/1745/24587.htm) and [Prof. Chun Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/chun123cheng/home). 

My research focuses on automated vehicle control and safety evaluation, as well as broader applications of AI and optimization in intelligent transportation systems.

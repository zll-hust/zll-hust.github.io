---permalink: /title: "Welcome to Hang's homepage!"author_profile: trueredirect_from:   - /about/  - /about.html---## About meMy name is Hang Zhou, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison in the [Connected & Autonomous Transportation Systems (CATS) Laboratory](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiaopeng â€œShawâ€ Li](https://catslab.engr.wisc.edu/staff/xiaopengli/). I got a Masterâ€™s degree from UWâ€“Madison at 2025 and a Bachelorâ€™s degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology at 2023, where I worked with [Prof. Hu Qin](https://cm.hust.edu.cn/info/1745/24587.htm) and [Prof. Chun Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/chun123cheng/home).## Research interestsMy research mainly applies methods from artificial intelligence and optimization to address the challenges posed by **emerging technologies in transportation**. My current research focuses on **Production Automated Vehicle (PAV) evaluation**. Since PAV manufacturers always do not disclose the internal control algorithms, we propose a data-driven pipeline for evaluating PAV performance from PAV-related data. To promote research across different steps of this pipeline, we initiated an open-source ecosystem: **the [OpenPAV](https://github.com/OpenPAV/OpenPAV) platform**. Our goal is to establish a billboard showcasing the performance ranking of various PAV brands to offer the public a scientific reference.![alt text](../images/method.png)Besides, I'm also interested in the **routing, trajectory planning, and montion control of robotics** and **urban air mobility**. I'm always trying to integrate theoretical analysis with physical tests.![alt text](../images/system.png)## NewsI have passed my preliminary exam with the dissereation title "A data-driven pipeline for the safety evaluation of production automated vehicles". Thanks to all my committee members and lab members!I plan to attend the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. between January 10 - January 14 2026 to present our study "DEVELOPING A FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM FOR URBAN AIR MOBILITY TRAFFIC FLOW BASED ON PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS" (å¸®æˆ‘æŠŠè®ºæ–‡åå­—æ¢æˆå°å†™) ä»¥åŠå…¶ä»–æˆ‘å‚ä¸Žçš„6ä¸ªå·¥ä½œã€‚ feel free to check our studies and connect with me!
